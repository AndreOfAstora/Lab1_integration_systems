# Lab1_integration_systems
Lab is done by Kovalchuck Andrey and Dmitry Ivanko - students of IO-41. 
We appologize that this repo is ugly, messy and full of failed attempts to rebase.
But i think we have completed all the tasks for lab 1. 
Commits of all teammates, revert and rebase commits are present, also we have one example of rebase(http://kpi-integration.appspot.com/lectures/Practice-1.pdf here you mentioned that one example of rebase is enogh).
